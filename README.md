# Sauna OS

Sauna OS is a web application that allows users to control and monitor a sauna. It consists of two components:

- [frontend](./frontend/README.md): the user interface for controlling the sauna
- [backend](./backend/README.md): the server that controls the sauna

## Functionality

With Sauna OS, users can:

- Turn the sauna on and off
- Control the temperature
- Enable/disable lights and color effects
- Monitor the current temperature and target temperature
- Monitor the status of each sauna panel
- Set a timer

## Basic Parts Required

Sauna OS requires a Raspberry Pi with relay switches and a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature in the sauna and the relay switches are used to control the sauna's heating panels, light, and color.

## Installation and Usage

Please refer to the `README.md` files in the `frontend` and `backend` subdirectories for instructions on how to install and use Sauna OS.
